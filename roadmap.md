## Phase 1 - Proof of concept ##
Arduino TV out with Character test - no connection to radio yet 
Use a FOR loop or other to show that text changes and the devices is not crashing.

## Phase 2 - 
Config saves 
D pad, select/Save, back/no save 

## Phase 3- Basic txt Displays 
Mix strings and variables on the same line 

## Phase 4 -
<STRIKE>micic onboard 7100 display </STRIKE>
Mimicing an ewxisint disaply is not currently possible given the current TVout library 

### Data on main disaply 
Line1	Operating frequency A
Line2	Mode
Line3	transceiver ID
Line4	S-meter level
Line5	SWR Meter
Line6 Not set
Line7 Not set
Line8 Not set
Line9 Not set
Line0 Not set

### Update screen when user changes main disaply layout 
Check for command to update when info changes 


## Phase 5 - support for other radios 


## Phase 6 - Future Updates 
Setting clock. - routin to set clock on either unit
