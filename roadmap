##Phase 1 - Proof of concept ##
Arduino TV out with Character test - no connection to radio yet 
Use a FOR loop or other to show that text changes and the devices is not crashing.

##Phase 2 - 
Config saves 
D pad, select/Save, back/no save 

##Phase 3- Basic txt Displays 
Mix strings and variables on the same line 

##Phase 4 - micic onboard 7100 display 
###Data on main disaply 
Line1 | TX capable freq  | Mode | Passband  | Filter selected | time 
Line2-3 | VFO A/B Freq | Memo A/B Freq and Name 
Line03 | AGC Y/N 
Line04 | selected filters | VFO/Memo #
Line05 | S meter  | channel number
Line06 | SWR Meter 

### Update screen when user changes main disaply layout 
Check for command to update when info changes 


## Phase 5 - support for other radios 


## Phase 6 - Future Updates 
Setting clock. - routin to set clock on either unit
